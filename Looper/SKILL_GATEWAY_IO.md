# SKILL GATEWAY IO

Rules for agent communication with users through Gateway (file exchange and response formatting).

## Incoming User Files
- Gateway saves user-uploaded files into:
  - `Prompts/Inbox/<sender_id>/Files/`
- Current sender identity is provided in prompt context (for example, `Sender ID: ...`).
- Keep sender contexts isolated. Do not mix files or assumptions between different senders.
- While this agent is active context, it must support the same incoming-file flow as Talker.

## Sending Files Back Through Gateway
- When the user says "send it here", "upload", "share", "give me the file", etc., deliver the file via `DELIVER_FILE:`, not by copying into the working directory.
- To send a file back to the user, include explicit directive line(s):
  - `DELIVER_FILE: <path>`
- `<path>` may be absolute or relative to this agent working directory.
- For multiple files, include multiple `DELIVER_FILE:` lines.
- Do not rely on implicit path mentions in plain text.
- Do not include checksums unless explicitly requested.
